A website built using the GAE-Init Broilerplate

This is used to show off some of the projects I have created.

This website pulls data down from TMDB API. It presents the user with current day's shows and any shows that are going to air within the next 7 days. Users can also search for specific shows and movies. The website displays some basic information about shows and movies. Users can leave comments and add shows to favorites.
